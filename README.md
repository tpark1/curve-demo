# curve-demo

## todo
* Curve shortening flow!
* Epsilon tuning
* Animations still not smooth :(
* rename test in UtilityFunctions
  * abstract out the t in test 

## notes
* convolution sometimes fails on vertical slope comparisons - ie the control point will
evaluate to +/-14 or something but the curve only gets up to +/-5


csf goes rightward only
think I'm going to go back to front tracking
